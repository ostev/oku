export const title = "Greeting others"

Saying hello to yourself is all well and good, but wouldn't it be nice to have someone to talk to? Let me introduce you to my good friend Peggy. She's the smiling television a couple of metres in front of me.

In order to go up to her and greet her, I need to introduce you to a new command: <DocLink symbol="move">`move`</DocLink>. Unlike <DocLink symbol="say">`say`</DocLink>, <DocLink symbol="move">`move`</DocLink> takes three <DocLink symbol="parameter">parameters</DocLink>, all of which are <DocLink symbol="number">numbers</DocLink>:

```javascript
move(0.5, 1, 3)
```

The first two <DocLink symbol="number">numbers</DocLink> indicate the amount of power to provide to my left and right engines, respectively. In this example, I would turn left since you are providing more power to the right engine than the left. The third number indicates the amount of time in seconds you want me to move for. So, this example tells me to turn left for 3 seconds.

Peggy is in front of me, so I need to move forward. I need to be within 1 metre of her to say hello.

<YourTurn>
<Goal>Move within one metre of Peggy and <DocLink symbol="say">say</DocLink> something to her.</Goal>

```javascript
// Hint: use both the `move` and `say` functions
```

</YourTurn>
