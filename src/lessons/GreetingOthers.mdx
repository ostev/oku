Saying hello to yourself is all well and good, but wouldn't it be nice to have
someone to talk to? Let me introduce you to my good friend Peggy. She's the
smiling television a couple of metres in front of me.

In order to go up to her and greet her, I need to introduce you to a new
command: <DocLink symbol="move">`move`</DocLink>. Unlike

<DocLink symbol="say">`say`</DocLink>, <DocLink symbol="move">`move`</DocLink>
takes three <DocLink symbol="parameter">parameters</DocLink>, all of which are
<DocLink symbol="number">numbers</DocLink>:

```javascript
move(0.5, 1, 3)
```

Each of the three <DocLink symbol="parameter">parameters</DocLink> are
sepearated by <DocLink symbol="comma">commas (`,`)</DocLink>--otherwise, I
wouldn't know where one parameter ends and the next begins! That would be
awfully confusing. You'll get an error if you forget one of these commas, so
remember to put them in.

The first two <DocLink symbol="number">numbers</DocLink> indicate the amount of
power to provide to my left and right engines, respectively. In this example, I
would turn left since you are providing more power to the right engine than the
left. The third number indicates the amount of time in seconds you want me to
move for. So, this example tells me to turn left for 3 seconds.

Peggy is in front of me, so I need to move forward. I need to be within 1 metre
of her to say hello. You need to use both
<DocLink symbol="move">`move`</DocLink> and
<DocLink symbol="say">`say`</DocLink> in the same program. You can give me
multiple commands by seperating them with newlines. Each one of these
<DocLink symbol="statement">`statements`</DocLink> is kind of like a sentence,
and newlines are kind of like full stops.

```javascript
// Laugh maniacally.
say("Ha ha ha ha!")

// Move backward for four seconds
move(-1, -1, 4)

// Laugh again
say("Hee hee hee hee!")
```

<YourTurn>
<Goal>Move within one metre of Peggy and speak to her.</Goal>

```javascript
// Hint: use both the `move` and `say` functions
```
