Let's extend our song and dance routine a little bit and add some more move variations. I'm going to introduce you to a new programming concept in this one, so hold tight.

You may have noticed that both the example and your own code were highly repetitive. If you wanted to change something, you would have to find and replace every occurrence of it across the program! For instance, if I wanted to increase the dramatic pauses and change the lyrics of the chorus, I would have to replace `4` everywhere and painstakingly type out the lyrics again and again for each repetition. Isn't that annoying?

Programmers like you have three core tools we use to address this problem:

<DocLink symbol="variable">variables</DocLink>,
<DocLink symbol="loop">loops</DocLink> and
<DocLink symbol="function">functions</DocLink>. You've used
<DocLink symbol="function">functions</DocLink> already--they're the commands
used to make me sing and dance. <DocLink symbol="say">`say`</DocLink>, <DocLink symbol="move">`forward`</DocLink>, <DocLink symbol="left">`left`</DocLink>, <DocLink symbol="right">`right`</DocLink>, <DocLink symbol="backward">`backward`</DocLink> and
<DocLink symbol="wait">`wait`</DocLink> are all functions. In case you don't
remember, you <DocLink symbol="functionCall">call</DocLink> a function by adding 
<DocLink symbol="paranthesis">parantheses</DocLink> and surrounding the parameters of the function.

{/* seperated by <DocLink symbol="comma">commas</DocLink>, like this: */}

```javascript
```

You'll learn how to make your own functions later on. We'll worry about loops later as well. They allow me to repeatedly perform tasks within you having to give me a new command each time, saving an inordinate amount of typing for you!

For now, let's focus on the first of the triad:

<DocLink symbol="variable">variables</DocLink>. Variables are values we can
define and then reuse throughout our program. If you're familiar with algebra,
they're kind of like the all the $x$s and $y$s you define when solving a
problem.

We declare a variable using the following code:

```javascript
let speed = 3
```

<DocLink symbol="let">`let`</DocLink> is an example of a <DocLink symbol="keyword">keyword</DocLink>--that's why it's highlighted purple. <DocLink symbol="keyword">keywords</DocLink> introduce certain <DocLink symbol="statement">statements</DocLink> like variable declarations. `speed` is the name of the <DocLink symbol="variable">variable</DocLink>, and the <DocLink symbol="assignmentOperator">equals sign (`=`)</DocLink> separates the name from its value. We can now refer to the <DocLink symbol="number">number</DocLink> `3` by the name `speed` instead of its value. That allows us to easily adjust the speed of the routine without changing every single occurrence of the number `3`! We can also use the mathematical operators we learned about earlier to adjust the duration of the pause.

<Challenge difficulty="easy">Try changing the value of `speed` to something else and see how the program changes.</Challenge>

```javascript
let speed = 3

say("La la la!")
wait(speed)

say("La la la!")
wait(speed + 1.5)

say("I love to sing!")
wait(speed * 2)
```

<YourTurn>
Programmers often spend time <DocLink symbol="refactor">refactoring</DocLink>--that is, they rewrite sections of already working code to make it cleaner and easier to maintain. Refactors can often help eliminate <DocLink symbol="bug">bugs</DocLink> and other problems with the code by making it easier to understand.

<Goal>
Refactor your existing program from <Ref chapter={1} section={3}>"Song and dance ðŸŽ¤"</Ref> to integrate variables.
</Goal>

<Hint number={1}>Create a variable called `speed`.</Hint>
<Hint number={2}>Use mathematical operators like `+`, `-`, `*` and `/` to derive the different wait times from `speed`</Hint>
<Hint number={3}>
Here's a scaffold:

```javascript
// static

let speed = [insert speed here]

say("I am going to sing some lyrics!")
wait(speed * 2)

say("It is really fun!")
wait(speed * (5 / 3))
```
</Hint>

<Challenge difficulty="medium">
In <DocLink symbol="javascript">JavaScript</DocLink>, you can also add <DocLink symbol="string">strings</DocLink> together using the addition operator (`+`). Create a new variable called `baseLyrics` and add strings to it for the lines of the chorus, like this:

```javascript
let speed = 2
let baseLyrics = "La la"

say(baseLyrics + " loo!")
wait(speed)
say(baseLyrics + " whoo!")
```
</Challenge>
