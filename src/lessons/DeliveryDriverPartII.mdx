Now that I've learnt how to carry parcels, it's time to deliver Arnold's bird feed! Arnold lives in a house opposite the road, up a long driveway blocked by a large gate. It's pretty darn heavy--it's built for humans, not for birds or robots! Arnold's owners exit and enter the house at irregular intervals in their huge vehicles to "run errands" and "work", whatever that means. I need to check whether the gate is open or not before I can proceed up the driveway. I can do that using the <DocLink symbol="readDistance">`readDistance`</DocLink> <DocLink symbol="function">function</DocLink>:

```javascript
// 1
let distance = readDistance()

say(distance)
```

If I say a value less than 1, the gate is closed. Otherwise, the gate is opened. Simple logic, right? We can communicate this to my internal computer more or less the same way I just said: using something known as an <DocLink symbol="if">`if`</DocLink> <DocLink symbol="statement">statement</DocLink>. <DocLink symbol="statement">Statements</DocLink> are individual lines of code seperated by a newline, each of which is a command. We covered these earlier, and they look like this:

```javascript
// 2
say("Hey!")
wait(2)
forward(1)
turn(90)
```

An <DocLink symbol="if">`if`</DocLink> <DocLink symbol="statement">statement</DocLink> is a *special* kind of statement that allows me to make decisions. You, the programmer, specify a condition. If that condition is true, I run the code that follows the <DocLink symbol="if">`if`</DocLink> <DocLink symbol="statement">statement</DocLink>:

```javascript
// 3
// no-run
if ([insert condition here]) {
    [insert code here]
}
```

The <DocLink symbol="paranthesis">parantheses</DocLink> tell me where the condition starts and ends, and the <DocLink symbol="curly-braces">curly braces (`{` and `}`)</DocLink> let me know when the code you want me to run starts and ends. If you don't include these little bits of punctuation, you'll get an <DocLink symbol="error">error</DocLink>. It's like forgetting to put a full stop or a comma in an English sentence, except, as a robot, I can't guess what you mean if you put them in the wrong place.

Programmers call this <DocLink symbol="boolean">boolean logic</DocLink>, named after [George Boole](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/George_Boole), a 19th-century English mathematician, statistician and logician. A <DocLink symbol="boolean">boolean</DocLink> value, or "bool" for short, can be one of two things: <DocLink symbol="true">`true`</DocLink> or <DocLink symbol="false">`false`</DocLink>:

```javascript
// 4
say(true)
wait(2)

say(false)
wait(2)

// Just for fun ðŸ¤£
say(true + "dat.")
```

So, using these new <DocLink symbol="boolean">boolean</DocLink> values, I can determine whether I should execute some code or not:

```javascript
// 5
// Run this...
if (true) {
    say("Hey there!")
}

// ...but not this
if (false) {
    say("You'll never here this message.")
}
```

That doesn't seem very useful! If you just use <DocLink symbol="true">`true`</DocLink> and <DocLink symbol="false">`false`</DocLink> as conditions, you might as well not have the <DocLink symbol="if">`if`</DocLink> <DocLink symbol="statement">statement</DocLink> in the first place! Instead, we can use one of several new <DocLink symbol="operator">operators</DocLink>:

| Operator | Description                                                | Example                  |
|----------|------------------------------------------------------------|--------------------------|
| `x === y`| Checks whether value $$x$$ is equal to value $$y$$         | `(1 + 2 === 3) === true` |
| `x > y`  | Checks whether value $$x$$ is greater than value $$y$$.    | `2 > 1 === true`         |
| `x < y`  | Checks whether value $$x$$ is less than value $$y$$.       | `2 < 1 === false`        |

The equality operator is the only one we've met so far that has a symbol different to mathematics--`===` instead of $$=$$. This is to avoid confusion with <DocLink symbol="variable">variable</DocLink> declarations, since the <DocLink symbol="assignment">`=` operator</DocLink> is already used for assigning names to things. Unlike human mathematicians, I can't easily intuit what you mean from context--instead, I require explicit instruction.

TThese <DocLink symbol="operator">operators</DocLink> are kind of like the arithmetic operators we met earlier, but they give back a <DocLink symbol="boolean">boolean</DocLink> value rather than a number--that is, <DocLink symbol="true">`true`</DocLink> or <DocLink symbol="false">`false`</DocLink> rather than $$1$$, $$2$$, $$3$$, etc. his means we can use them in the <DocLink symbol="condition">condition</DocLink> portion of our <DocLink symbol="if">`if`</DocLink> <DocLink symbol="statement">statement</DocLink>:

```javascript
// 6
// This will run...
if (5 > 3) {
    say("5 is indeed greater than three!")
}

wait(2)

// ...so will this...
if (2 === 2) {
    say("2 does indeed equal 2!")
}

wait(2)

// ...but this won't...
if (5 < 3) {
    say("Unfortunately, 5 is not less than three.")
}
```

<Goal index={1}>Replace `5 < 3` with a condition that will cause the last <DocLink symbol="say">`say`</DocLink> commands to run.</Goal>

When we combine this with <DocLink symbol="variable">variables</DocLink>, as we learnt about in the previous two lessons, we get something that's actually useful:

```javascript
// 7

// Get the distance between me and the closest object
// in front of me and store it in `distance`.
let distance = readDistance()

// Check whether the gate is closed
if (distance < 1) {
    say("Unfortunately, the gate is closed. How sad!")
}
```

<Goal index={2}>Add some flair to the code inside that <DocLink symbol="if">`if`</DocLink> <DocLink symbol="statement">statement</DocLink>. Perhaps I need to dance the robot? ðŸ¤–</Goal>

<Goal index={3}>Replace the condition `distance < 1` with one that checks whether the gate is open (whether distance is greater than one).</Goal>

We have one last thing to learn about before we can deliver this bird feed, which we'll cover in the next lesson.
