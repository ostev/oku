Now that we've made some friends, let's put on a show! Peggy is a very talented
instrumentalist, so she'll be providing accompaniment to my amazing vocal
talents!

```javascript
say("La la la laaa!")
```

I'm great, right? The trouble is, I'm not a very creative robot. I need some
help thinking of apropriate lyrics and dance routines. And that is where you,
pathetic human, come in. But there is another tool in my toolbox I need to teach
you about first.

While speaking and moving is all well and good, in order for a dance routine to
be great, it needs to be carefully timed. The lyrics need to be one with the
moves, and it needs to match the pace of the song. Sometimes, you might want to
pause for dramatic effect, or wait until I've finished singing a line to start
the next one. That's where <DocLink symbol="wait">`wait`</DocLink> comes in!

```javascript
// Move forward for 1.5 seconds
move(1, 1, 1.5)

// Pause for dramatic effect for 1 second
wait(1)

// The reveal...
say("Ta-da!")
```

<DocLink symbol="wait">`wait`</DocLink> takes one <DocLink symbol="parameter">
    parameter
</DocLink>
: the number of seconds I need to wait. Unlike a human, I don't get impatient, so
I can wait as long as you want! (Within limits, of course.)

<YourTurn>

<Goal>
    Craft a dance routine involving singing using `say`, moving using `move` and
    waiting using `wait`.
</Goal>

```javascript

```
