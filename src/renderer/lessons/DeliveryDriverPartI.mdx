I've found a job! ðŸŽ‰ Arnold said he'd employ me to deliver his bird feed to his perch. Isn't that simply fantastic!

There's a catch, however. The back gate to Arnold's house won't be open all the time, and I don't have the human hands necessary to operate it. I also need to be able to pick up the parcel and place it down inside the door, which is why I have some shiny new upgrades! Do you spy that claw on the front of my chassis, as well as the distance sensor which looks kind of like a pair of eyes?

In addition to all that, I have to cross a road to reach Arnold's kennel, and I don't particularly feel like being smashed into little pieces by an oncoming vehicle. What should I do?

You know the drill by know--new functionality means new <DocLink symbol="function">functions</DocLink>! Let me introduce you to <DocLink symbol="readDistance">`readDistance`</DocLink>:

```javascript
// 1
let distance = readDistance()
```

Unlike the functions we've seen up to this point, <DocLink symbol="readDistance">`readDistance`</DocLink> doesn't take any parameters! Instead, it gives us some information about the world. Programmers say that <DocLink symbol="readDistance">`readDistance`</DocLink> <DocLink symbol="return">returns</DocLink> a value--in this case, a number indicating the distance in metres to the closest object in front of me. We can then use that number to perform other tasks. In this case, we <DocLink symbol="assignment">assign</DocLink> it to a <DocLink symbol="variable">variable</DocLink>, but we could also speak it out loud or move that distance:

```javascript
// 2
say(readDistance())

forward(readDistance())
```

We still need the <DocLink symbol="parenthesis">parentheses</DocLink>--otherwise, we'll probably get an error.

Picking up and placing objects is more straightforward: we simply use the <DocLink symbol="pickUp">`pickUp`</DocLink> and <DocLink symbol="placeDown">`placeDown`</DocLink> functions when I'm in front of a parcel:

```javascript
// 3
forward(1)
pickUp()
backward(1)
placeDown()
```

Using this <DocLink symbol="function">function</DocLink>, we can tell the distance between me and the car--very handy for avoiding a collision! We'll actually deliver the parcel in <Ref chapter={3} section={1}>the next section</Ref>. For now, let's practise moving parcels around!

<YourTurn>

<Goal index={1}>
Using the <DocLink symbol="readDistance">`readDistance`</DocLink>, <DocLink symbol="pickUp">`pickUp`</DocLink> and <DocLink symbol="placeDown">`placeDown`</DocLink> functions, place the parcel in the receptacle. The position of the parcel relative to me will change each run.
</Goal>

<Hint index={1}>
You'll have to measure the distance between me and the parcel, and then between me and the stone at the end of the path.
</Hint>

<Hint index={2}>
Move forward by about the measured amounts.
</Hint>

```javascript
// 4
```

</YourTurn>
